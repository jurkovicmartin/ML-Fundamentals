# ML Fundamentals

## About
This repository is about my entrance to the machine learning problematic and track my journey to learn and understand ML fundamentals. Repository contains from scratch coded models with examples and short documentation.

**!Caution: For simplicity most of the input parameters are not checked. Wrong or illogical inputs are not handled in the examples!**

### Motivation
My first attempt with neural networks was when i made a digit recognition network with TensorFlow Keras model. Building that network was really simple and it worked. Still to this day it seems actually fascinating to me how these structures works and can "program" themselves to perform some specific task.

It was about that time when i decided that i want to learn more about this topic. I want to know more about the operations that happen inside the model. Well, this repository is about that. It tracks my learning journey with documentation that i make with "my words". I suppose that making documentation this way will be easy to follow and understand for possibly later reviews.

## Layout
Repository is divided into multiple folders. Name of each folder gives a hint about its content. Each of these folder contains a model (network) with example usage. Part of it is also a short documentation. In the documentation my intention is to capture the main points about how the model works and what are some key characteristics. Also some kind of implementation theory is there. On top of that it contains my notes and my results from usage example.

All of the information i present here is what i watched or read. It is my interpretation of that information so I admit that there can be some mistakes or misunderstandings.
