## Layout
Repository layout is simple. Each folder contains one "model". Each model is somehow different and each one is separately documented. The documentation is written in my own words and mirrors how I understand the problem. Also my insights are recorded here.

- Perceptron => Single neuron
- Single_Layer => Single layer network with multiple neurons
